    <p>We're very excited about providing a conference <a href="/format">format</a> which will drive real interaction between sponsors and participants. You'll have access to "focus group" style discussions after each and every talk where you can learn what people are looking for from you, their partners. </p>
      
    <p>Gold sponsors will get a full length talk and the same twenty minute discussion to show off how they've solved specific problems for other people (no sales pitches so we can keep interest high!).</p>

    <p>Our goal is to make everyone experiences the event as full participants, whether they be attendees or sponsors. This format costs a bit more to provide, but as a volunteer run, not for profit event we'll be stretching every dollar to make sure you get great value</p>
