Cora lives and codes in Chicago with her cats, spouse, and one deployed startup human. She loves a meaty code challenge and is not afraid to read a library's code base to fill-in what the documentation left out. While she started in Ruby and JavaScript, she now lives in the land of Java and loves to not block her threads.
