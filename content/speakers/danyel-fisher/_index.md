Danyel Fisher is a Principal Design Researcher for Honeycomb.io. His work focuses on ways to help users interact with data more easily. Before he started at Honeycomb, he spent thirteen years at Microsoft Research, looking (among other things) at ways to make big data analytics faster and more interactive with incremental visualization. He received his MS from UC Berkeley, and his PhD from UC Irvine.

### Fast & simple: observing code & infra deployments at Honeycomb

You don't need kubernetes to automatically push green builds to production -- learn how Honeycomb has utilized CircleCI, Terraform, Chef, a collection of home-grown scripts, and Honeycomb itself to speed up its deployments and make them safer. We'll talk about what went wrong along the way, and how we used our Service Level Objectives to evaluate and mitigate the risks.
