Steve has had experience with complex, scaling organizations since being born into the middle of a family of what is now 6 kids. Ever since he was an infant, he's been taking things apart (starting with rotary phones and typewriters!) and reimagining how they fit together. He once moved into his closet for a week because it would keep his room clean and bed made without touching it. He's become a bit more practical and less idealistic over the years, but no less obsessed with simplicity and optimization. He was always encouraged to be curious and resourceful and to speak up, experiment and think big - and that's always how he's lived and worked.

He spends warm months in Toronto and cold months trying to escape.
