One of the biggest differences with DeliveryConf from other events you have may have attended or volunteered at is our format. This format was conceived to encourage attendees to have discussions about how topics discussed affect their own organizations. After each talk there are 20 minutes set aside for discussion. We want everyone to leave having learned *how* to do something valuable, not just that they should.

##### Most important rule: These are discussions about the TOPIC, not the talk

Other rules:

- Stick to the time box. There are other tracks which will be starting on time. Don't make people late.
- Nobody is allowed to speak if they aren't on a microphone. These discussions are being recorded at the sound board and will be distributed. Cross talk will make everything sound bad.
- The speaker is not required to stay. They are more than welcome of course, but they won't have their own microphone anymore. As stated this is meant to be a discussion about the topic, not the specific talk.

Time Box:

- 20 minutes - Split into 6-7 minutes for each question. We know this isn't enough time to get deep, but there are lots of places in the venue for folks to continue discussions later. The goal here is to get discussion started while the topic is fresh.
- Participants will be asked to cap any one question or answer to 30 seconds. We need to avoid anyone dominating the conversation.

The questions:

- What challenges are you facing in this area? This question is designed to let people ask for help.
- What successes have you had in this area? There are things people have done in every topic area that would benefit the others.
- If you had a magic wand, what would you want to see in 2-5 years? There will be many people in attendance who can influence the tools and platforms available to us. Let them know what we need.

Running the session:

- There are two staff members required for each session, one facilitator and one mic runner. The facilitator should be the same person who introduced the speaker.
- When the talk is over, the facilitator invites people in the audience who would like to participate in the discussion to come forward while the facilitator is switching over the computer and getting the microphone from the speaker. This is done to provide an obvious mental switch in "what's happening now" and a couple minutes for folks to move around.
- Each room will have 2 hand held microphones. The facilitator should hold on to one of them, and the runner holds the other.
- When someone wants to speak, the runner holds the microphone up to their mouth so that they can speak. DO NOT hand the microphone over. Most people don't know [how to hold a microphone](https://youtu.be/c9ZaQFCxQr8?t=13) properly, and you might have to wrestle them to get it back.
- When the session is over, the facilitator should do a short "thank you" wrap up so that the recording doesn't end abruptly.

Keep in mind:

- The facilitator and runner should take great care to not let a couple people dominate the discussion. Limit any one question or answer to 30 seconds.
- Enforce the "don't talk if you're not speaking into a microphone" rule at all times.
- The facilitator is responsible for carefully keeping track of time. We have promoted the format and questions quite a bit. There will likely be people who are very interested in only one of the questions. It's important that we get to all three.
- "When it's over, it's over" - but only if you're ending early. If the discussion dries out, or the questions don't spur enough conversation, don't feel like you need to drag it out of people. Move on, or even wrap it up early.
