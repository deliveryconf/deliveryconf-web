Giving a talk on [CI/CD Agility And Controlling Pipeline Sprawl](/talks/ci-cd-agility-and-controlling-pipeline-sprawl/)<br>

#### What is the biggest improvement you've seen on engineering teams after they've implemented CI/CD?

The biggest improvement I've noticed from teams that have implemented CI/CD practices is increased awareness and communication among team members. Teams that have adopted and implemented CI/CD urges individuals to socialize around codebases resulting in a deeper understanding and stronger connection to codebases and optimizes software development processes. 

#### What excites you the most about your talk? 

Addressing pipeline management at scale, the issues teams are facing with current CI/CD tooling and sharing ideas on resolving these issues in general

#### What do you think will be the biggest change in CI/CD over the next 3-5 years? 

Autonomous pipelines will be the next evolution in the next five years. Pipelines will have the capability of mitigating failed builds without human intervention. For example, a build step fails due to a failed vulnerability scan in a dependency library in a pipeline. The CI/CD tooling will be able to update the vulnerable library, then automatically test the application using the newly updated libraries. Autonomous Pipelines will provide next level efficiencies in CI/CD and DevOps automation.
