This panel is part of our desire to learn from what people are doing today, and help shape what we’ll be able to do tomorrow. 

Most of the content at any event is about how people have done things, and what they have learned while doing them. Here, we’re taking a different approach. We’re asking experienced leaders from diverse technical backgrounds what they think the future holds. 

This will be a moderated panel with questions that were gathered from the conference participants. 

Predicting the future is hard, but we’re going to ask our panel to do it anyway!
