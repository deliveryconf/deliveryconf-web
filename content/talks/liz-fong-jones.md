###  Fast & simple: observing code & infra deployments at Honeycomb 

You don't need kubernetes to automatically push green builds to production -- learn how Honeycomb has utilized CircleCI, Terraform, Chef, a collection of home-grown scripts, and Honeycomb itself to speed up its deployments and make them safer. We'll talk about what went wrong along the way, and how we used our Service Level Objectives to evaluate and mitigate the risks.
