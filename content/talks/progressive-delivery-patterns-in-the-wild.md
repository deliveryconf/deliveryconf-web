Progressive Delivery and the statistical observation of real users (sometimes known as “shift right testing” or “feature experimentation”) are essential CD practices. They free teams up to move fast, limit the blast radius of issues found in production and focus engineering cycles on work that delivers results, not just releases.

We'll drill into the ways booking.com, LinkedIn and Facebook have implemented Progressive Delivery and how they have automated monitoring and statistical "sensemaking" into their gradual release pipelines, building trust and scalability into their practices.

We'll wrap up with a checklist summarizing the key capabilities these pioneers have built into their delivery flows, equipping you to establish or extend these powerful patterns in your own environment.
