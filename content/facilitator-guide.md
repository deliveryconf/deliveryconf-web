Each session will have a facilitator to run that session from a DeliveryConf standpoint.

Responsibilities:

- Ensure the speaker(s) are in the room during the break prior to the session so that they can be mic'd up and plugged in to the projector.
- Introduce the speaker (please keep the intro simple to not eat into the talk time).
- Track the time of the talk.
- Sit directly in front of the speaker to give them time updates. We will print papers with 10, 5, and 1 on them to hold up at the proper time.
- End the talk on time.
- Thank the speaker.
- Invite members of the audience to form a circle to discuss the topic. See the [Format Guide](/format-guide/) for more information.
- While the audience is forming the circle, plug the conference laptop into the projector with the proper slide showing. Remember, the recording is still running! We may edit out the time delay, but while the discussion is happening whatever is on the laptop will be what people see on YouTube.
